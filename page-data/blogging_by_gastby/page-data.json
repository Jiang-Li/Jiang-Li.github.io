But recently I used Python more and more and would\nlike to switch a more general tool. The static site built by Gastby, which is powered by React, is pretty fast. So I\ndecided to give a try. Here is the workflow of blogging:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the project folder, enter:\n<code class=\"language-text\">gatsby develop</code></li>\n<li>Add new markdown file in the content/blog. I will prefer to build folder for each post, and compose a index.md inside the folder.</li>\n<li>To deploy, build the side using <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby build</code> and push the <code class=\"language-text\">public</code> folder to git hub page repo. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The blog is build based on Gatsby’s blog starter. </li>\n<li>To create the template\n<code class=\"language-text\">gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog</code>.</li>\n<li>I added code highlighting and modified the bio. I also want the supports of TOC and math formula, and will add it later.</li>\n<li>Although gatsby has\n<code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> package to publish the site automatically. But I found somehow the github’s project page, which is in the\n<code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> branch, takes a very long time to update. Thus, I still prefer to push the site directly to a repo of page.  </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blogging by Gastby","date":"July 20, 2019","description":"Try to use Gastby for blogging."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blogging_by_gastby/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/jupyter_rsconnect/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jupyter Notebook in RStudio Connect"}},"next":null}}}
