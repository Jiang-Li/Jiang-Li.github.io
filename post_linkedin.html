<p>In the past twelve weeks, I enjoyed teaching DATA 300, Introduction
to Analytics, at Franklin University. The students came from very
diverse backgrounds: Computer Science, Information Technology,
Information System, Accounting, Business Administration, etc. This is
not surprising as analytics has been involved in various roles in the
industry. We discussed the fundamental analytics topics, including
#datawrangling, Descriptive Analytics, #datavisualization, Statistical
inference, #regressionanalysis, Simulations, and Optimizations. Most
students showed strong learning motivation and many of them did great
jobs! IMO the prompt out-of-class feedback is critical to productive
online learning. I am glad that we chose McGraw Hill’s smart book in
this redesigned course, which helps students understand the key concepts
with reading questions and immediate feedback. Check it out if you are
curious how does the smark book work: <a href="https://lnkd.in/ems7qGHf"

<p>The latest episode from “Talk Python to me” (<a
href="https://lnkd.in/eKRpC-SC"
class="uri">https://lnkd.in/eKRpC-SC</a>) is great. Stan Seibert from
Anaconda talked about what’s happening in the data science space in
2021. Some interesting takeaways from the 2021 State of Data Science
survey (<a href="https://lnkd.in/eKgEJtBV"
class="uri">https://lnkd.in/eKgEJtBV</a>) are: 1. 50% of respondents
said data science investment stayed the same or increased, meaning data
roles remained significant throughout the pandemic. 2. Data roles fall
within the organization everywhere. Most of the respondents’ roles fall
under IT (23%) and Research &amp; Development (16%). 3. 87% of
respondents said their organizations allow the use of open-source
software. 4. The top 3 analytics programming language are Python, SQL,
and R.</p>

<h2>Ed Discussion Tool</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6839630323928612864-MaJu">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, I found students who asked more questions often had
better grades. Asking questions works because it makes people active
learners instead of passive recipients of knowledge. When people
interact with information by elaborating on it and thinking critically
about its context, they learn more productively.</p>
<p>Recently, I started using Ed Discussion in analytics courses at
Franklin University. It is a fantastic tool that helps students ask
questions more efficiently. Students even can ask anonymously or
embedded the runnable code snippets. We did receive more questions :-).

<h2>Correlation vs. causation</h2>

<p>Machine Learning/Data Mining is great at finding correlations in
data, but not causation! How to make sure X causes Y then? (1) X must
occur before Y (2) There must be evidence of an association between X
and Y (3) Control other causal factors (confounders)</p>
<p>These are the basics we just discussed in the #businessanalytics
course at Franklin University. The thing is, experimentation is the only
way to assert that one action causes another to happen confidently.</p>
<p>In the above three requirements for causal statement, 3) is the most
challenging one. For example, it is hard to tell there is no confounder
when people claim a driver’s poor credit report causes a higher driving
risk. Here are more interesting discussions about this hot real-world
industry case FYI: <a href="https://lnkd.in/etzYZX5n"

<p>Product Analyst is an in-demand #businessanalytics role. When I was
in the insurance industry, I saw how the product analysts amazingly
improved the insurance products using their business acumen and

<p>Just discussed A/B Testing with students last night in a Marketing
Analytics course at Franklin University. Analytics professionals often
need to compare data. Instead of eyeballing, a statistical method can
tell us whether the difference is significant or not, which is way more
reliable and professional. Here is an article that walks through the
statistical significance when comparing data in A/B testing: <a

<p>I am teaching BUSA 603, Marketing Mgmt &amp; Analytics, this summer.
One thing that surprised me was, although some students use SQL daily in
their jobs, they heard SQL’s window functions for the first time. Window
functions (also known as analytical functions) are a kind of
aggregation. However, unlike regular aggregate functions, a window
function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output;
instead, it performs a calculation across a set of rows that are somehow
related to the current row. Thus, it is very convenient to get the
analytics metrics like running total, moving average, row difference,
etc. Please refer to the following great tutorial for more details: <a
href="https://lnkd.in/erHUSHx"

<p>If you are an adult learner, you must know that balancing work,
study, and life/family is challenging. Then, how to make the learning
more productive? Because most adult learners already have working
experience, as an educator, I think the most important thing is to build
relevancy between the experience and the learning. For example, during
the course design, I would ask myself how this course will offer working
adults the skill sets they need to improve their work performance? In
the past two months, to make the course more relevant, together with our
great Instructional designer (Jesse Fuhrman) and course editor (Marivic
Lesho), I redesigned DATA 610, a core course in Franklin University’s
M.S. in Business Analytics program, using the textbook, Data Mining of
Business Analytics (<a href="https://lnkd.in/eN7_TzQ"
class="uri">https://lnkd.in/eN7_TzQ</a>). I added many real-world
business analytics scenarios, and students will have more practice
solving real-world business problems based on data. I am excited that
the redesigned DATA 610 will start soon from next week and hope our
adult learners can enjoy it!</p>

<p>Although many data science competitions are available nowadays, ASA
DataFest, backed by The American Statistical Association (ASA), can
benefit students more effectively because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is an excellent opportunity to learn. Undergraduate students
do the work, but they are mentored by consultants who are graduate
students, faculty, and experienced industry professionals.</p></li>
<li><p>Its topics are well selected and very practical. In the past few
years, DataFest covered how to explore the impact of COVID-19, how to
recommend what major to choose in college based on Indeed data, how
visitor’s searches relate to the choices of hotels booked or not based
on Expedia data.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps students stand out in the competitive job market. Many
professionals find ASA DataFest is a great recruiting
opportunity.</p></li>

<p>When I first heard about Notion, I thought it was another note-taking
software like EndNote or OneNote. But soon, I found Notion is quite
different. It is more like a Lego Sets of Web App. You can use it to
build a webpage for blog, wiki, portfolio, project, class, etc., without
any programming. Many powerful tools often have a steep learning curve,
while Notion turns out to be very easy to learn and use. User experience
is the top priority of this fast-growing startup in San Francisco,
partially because its CEO and co-founder was an industrial designer.</p>
<p>Notion is very friendly for education. Its Pro version, which has
unlimited file upload, is free for students and educators.</p>
<p>The digital portfolio helps students get the job. The following video
shows how to build and share a portfolio using Notion in 15 min: <a

<p>In analytics projects using SQL, data duplication is a common mistake
that leads to misleading conclusions. When two tables are joined, the
left-side rows will be duplicate if the right-side matched variable is
not unique. The following animation from Thomas Neitmann’s blog

<h2>Why R is the right tool</h2>
<p><a

<p>Why R is the right tool to learn for Business Analytics
professionals? - It better supports business-ready analytics and
reports. - It is easy to learn thanks to tidyverse, a set of packages
with a consistent programming interface.</p>
<p>Why not Python, then? When I was in the industry, I feel R is more
productive in exploring business problems as it handles data
manipulation, modeling, and reporting very well in one platform. Python,
as a full-stack programming language, is well-suited for data scientists
and engineers. I would suggest both, but do not learn them at the same
time if you are new to programming.</p>

<p>What is the most important programming skill in Business Analytics?
Surprisingly, it is SQL instead of Python/R. SQL’s syntax is simple, but
it can describe “what you want” from data intuitively and conveniently.
Here is a great quick summary of SQL from the perspective of analytics
and data science: <a href="https://lnkd.in/eEV2kfx"

<h2>Confidence Interval</h2>

<p>When I discussed with our graduate assistant about a research project
yesterday, I suggested adding the confidence interval (CI) to the
descriptive analytics. The understanding of uncertainty is important in
business analytics. Here are how to get the empirical CI practically: 1.
Bootstrap the data n times (n is data-size dependent, usually 200 to
300). 2. Calculate the metrics for each data set. 3. Identify the 90% CI
of metrics by their 5% and 95% percentiles. Reference the following post
for a Python implementation: <a href="https://lnkd.in/g_hQRqZ"

<h2>Suggestion to students: get hands dirty</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6735202069420003329-7Btr">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Besides the two suggestions I gave students, “continue being curious”
and “be a problem solver”, the last one is to “get hands dirty”.
Business Analytics is to get insights from the historical data and
further drive business decisions. Thus, the understanding of data is
critical. There is no way to get data ready without getting hands dirty.
To this end, I would suggest having a broad exposure to data wrangling
tools, including SQL, R, and Python, if possible. If I only pick one, it
will be the SQL. Many new analytics professionals surprisingly found SQL
is far more important than what they thought. I used SQL very often when
I was a data scientist in the industry. Matt Bonakdarpour, the data
science VP of Root Inc., often said, “SQL is the cash you pay to get
what you want quickly.” When I discussed the M.S in Business Analytics
program with our advisory board member, Kimberly Klenk, she also
emphasized that SQL is an essential skill. If you are not confident
about SQL, here is a good tutorial: <a href="https://lnkd.in/ex8r9XN"

practice SQL in business analytics and see the results just using a web
browser.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6735025440374751233">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>There’s the joke that 80 percent of data science is cleaning the data
and 20 percent is complaining about cleaning the data 😃… Here the big
takeaway is, the data preparation is really very critical in the
industry. The following framework is a great guideline.</p>

<p>Besides the “continue being curious,” my second suggestion to my
students is “be a problem solver.” Instead of just monitoring and
reporting data, business analytics professionals have more exposure to
problem-solving. Thanks to the fast-growing analytics tools, business
analytics professionals may not need to know many mathematical details
like scientists and to write very complicated code like engineers.
However, in my opinion, they do need to clearly understand the principle
of data science to support analytical thinking. I highly recommend this
book, Data Science for Business (<a href="https://lnkd.in/eGHeVkC"
class="uri">https://lnkd.in/eGHeVkC</a>), as it is easy to read,
practical, and very friendly for the working adult learners.</p>

<p>After finish teaching the course on big data analytics last week,
what impressed me most is that the students in the Master of Science in
Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Health Informatics programs
showed a strong motivation and curiosity to learn. At Franklin
University, most students are working adults. Learning is challenging
because they have to balance work, life, and study. However, they know
what they want and are eager to pick up new knowledge, which is
fantastic! In the industry, good analysts professionals often ask
questions and enjoy learning something new. Thus, my first post-class
suggestion to my students is “to continue being curious,” which will
benefit the career development for sure, from an educator and former
data scientist’s perspective.</p>
