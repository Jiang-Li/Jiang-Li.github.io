I am Dr. Jiang 'John' Li, serving as the Program Chair for the M.S. in Business Analytics and B.S. in Analytics, as well as the Lead Faculty for the M.S. in Data Analytics at Franklin University. With a background as a Data Scientist in the Insurance Industry, I bring extensive experience in Analytics Modeling and am proficient in Analytics tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, R, and Tableau.

Earlier in my career, I conducted research in the Physics Department at Ohio State University, culminating in a publication in Nature, the world's most prestigious scientific journal. My current research interest lies in [Learning Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics).

As an enthusiastic educator, I design and teach analytics-related courses for both undergraduate and graduate students. I reside in Columbus, Ohio, with my wife and our three children.
