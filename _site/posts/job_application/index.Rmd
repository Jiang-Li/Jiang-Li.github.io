### Mock Interview

#### In ChatGPT, enter the following text, replace the highlighed text as needed:

I want you to act as an interviewer from **Chase bank at Columbus Ohio**. I will be the candidate and you will ask me the interview questions for the position of **data analyst**. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conservation at once. I want you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. My first sentence is "Hi".
