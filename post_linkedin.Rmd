## DATA 300: Introduction to Analytics

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_datawrangling-datavisualization-regressionanalysis-activity-6863938185991372800-4O2c)

In the past twelve weeks, I enjoyed teaching DATA 300, Introduction to Analytics, at Franklin University. The students came from very diverse backgrounds: Computer Science, Information Technology, Information System, Accounting, Business Administration, etc. This is not surprising as analytics has been involved in various roles in the industry. We discussed the fundamental analytics topics, including #datawrangling, Descriptive Analytics, #datavisualization, Statistical inference, #regressionanalysis, Simulations, and Optimizations. Most students showed strong learning motivation and many of them did great jobs! IMO the prompt out-of-class feedback is critical to productive online learning. I am glad that we chose McGraw Hill's smart book in this redesigned course, which helps students understand the key concepts with reading questions and immediate feedback. Check it out if you are curious how does the smark book work: https://lnkd.in/ems7qGHf

## Data Science in 2021

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_state-of-data-science-in-2021-activity-6843222852242608128-yj6H)

The latest episode from "Talk Python to me" (https://lnkd.in/eKRpC-SC) is great. Stan Seibert from Anaconda talked about what's happening in the data science space in 2021. Some interesting takeaways from the 2021 State of Data Science survey (https://lnkd.in/eKgEJtBV) are:
1. 50% of respondents said data science investment stayed the same or increased, meaning data roles remained significant throughout the pandemic.
2. Data roles fall within the organization everywhere. Most of the respondents' roles fall under IT (23%) and Research & Development (16%).
3. 87% of respondents said their organizations allow the use of open-source software.
4. The top 3 analytics programming language are Python, SQL, and R.

## Ed Discussion Tool

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6839630323928612864-MaJu)

Not surprisingly, I found students who asked more questions often had better grades. Asking questions works because it makes people active learners instead of passive recipients of knowledge. When people interact with information by elaborating on it and thinking critically about its context, they learn more productively.

Recently, I started using Ed Discussion in analytics courses at Franklin University. It is a fantastic tool that helps students ask questions more efficiently. Students even can ask anonymously or embedded the runnable code snippets. We did receive more questions :-). Check this quick start guide if you are interested in it: https://lnkd.in/eFVaYXnf

## Correlation vs. causation

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_bad-credit-or-no-credit-shouldnt-affect-activity-6831660659332198400-AkhL)

Machine Learning/Data Mining is great at finding correlations in data, but not causation! How to make sure X causes Y then? 
(1) X must occur before Y
(2) There must be evidence of an association between X and Y
(3) Control other causal factors (confounders)

These are the basics we just discussed in the #businessanalytics course at Franklin University. The thing is, experimentation is the only way to assert that one action causes another to happen confidently. 

In the above three requirements for causal statement, 3) is the most challenging one. For example, it is hard to tell there is no confounder when people claim a driver's poor credit report causes a higher driving risk. Here are more interesting discussions about this hot real-world industry case FYI: https://lnkd.in/etzYZX5n

## Product Analyst Role 

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_product-analysts-what-is-that-activity-6828681711170199552-IwdX)

Product Analyst is an in-demand #businessanalytics role. When I was in the insurance industry, I saw how the product analysts amazingly improved the insurance products using their business acumen and analytics skills. If you are curious what a product analyst does, this interesting article from my morning reading can tell you what is it and what skills are essential to this job, with some resources to learn them: https://lnkd.in/eWbQP-3Z

## A/B Testing

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_the-art-of-ab-testing-activity-6824374446371979264-SLOu)

Just discussed A/B Testing with students last night in a Marketing Analytics course at Franklin University. Analytics professionals often need to compare data. Instead of eyeballing, a statistical method can tell us whether the difference is significant or not, which is way more reliable and professional. Here is an article that walks through the statistical significance when comparing data in A/B testing: https://lnkd.in/er5R9tH

## BUSA 603: Marketing Analytics

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_top-five-sql-window-functions-you-should-activity-6820375641171533824-b1g6)

I am teaching BUSA 603, Marketing Mgmt & Analytics, this summer. One thing that surprised me was, although some students use SQL daily in their jobs, they heard SQL's window functions for the first time. Window functions (also known as analytical functions) are a kind of aggregation. However, unlike regular aggregate functions, a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output; instead, it performs a calculation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row. Thus, it is very convenient to get the analytics metrics like running total, moving average, row difference, etc. Please refer to the following great tutorial for more details: https://lnkd.in/erHUSHx

## Redesign DATA 610

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6798960640217145344-hmrk)

If you are an adult learner, you must know that balancing work, study, and life/family is challenging. Then, how to make the learning more productive? Because most adult learners already have working experience, as an educator, I think the most important thing is to build relevancy between the experience and the learning. For example, during the course design, I would ask myself how this course will offer working adults the skill sets they need to improve their work performance? In the past two months, to make the course more relevant, together with our great Instructional designer (Jesse Fuhrman) and course editor (Marivic Lesho), I redesigned DATA 610, a core course in Franklin University's M.S. in Business Analytics program, using the textbook, Data Mining of Business Analytics (https://lnkd.in/eN7_TzQ). I added many real-world business analytics scenarios, and students will have more practice solving real-world business problems based on data. I am excited that the redesigned DATA 610 will start soon from next week and hope our adult learners can enjoy it!

## DataFest

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6773637143085535233-ZF_N)


Although many data science competitions are available nowadays, ASA DataFest, backed by The American Statistical Association (ASA), can benefit students more effectively because:

1) It is an excellent opportunity to learn. Undergraduate students do the work, but they are mentored by consultants who are graduate students, faculty, and experienced industry professionals.

2) Its topics are well selected and very practical. In the past few years, DataFest covered how to explore the impact of COVID-19, how to recommend what major to choose in college based on Indeed data, how visitor's searches relate to the choices of hotels booked or not based on Expedia data.

3) It helps students stand out in the competitive job market. Many professionals find ASA DataFest is a great recruiting opportunity.

Franklin University will host a two-day ASA DataFest in the coming April. Here is how to register: https://lnkd.in/eSPKg8i

## Notion

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_notion-is-free-for-students-activity-6770738229156081664-SRMQ)

When I first heard about Notion, I thought it was another note-taking software like EndNote or OneNote. But soon, I found Notion is quite different. It is more like a Lego Sets of Web App. You can use it to build a webpage for blog, wiki, portfolio, project, class, etc., without any programming. Many powerful tools often have a steep learning curve, while Notion turns out to be very easy to learn and use. User experience is the top priority of this fast-growing startup in San Francisco, partially because its CEO and co-founder was an industrial designer.

Notion is very friendly for education. Its Pro version, which has unlimited file upload, is free for students and educators.

The digital portfolio helps students get the job. The following video shows how to build and share a portfolio using Notion in 15 min:

## SQL Data Duplication

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6764940052565946368-mMkJ)

In analytics projects using SQL, data duplication is a common mistake that leads to misleading conclusions. When two tables are joined, the left-side rows will be duplicate if the right-side matched variable is not unique. The following animation from Thomas Neitmann's blog perfectly shows why is that:

## RStudio::global 2021

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_rstudio-webinars-activity-6763195681315405824-fRGt)

rstudio::global (the former rstudio::conf) is one of my favorite conferences in the analytics field. It is enjoyable, informative, and the R community is very friendly. Talks from rstudio::global 2021 are now available at https://lnkd.in/gPNmWpW with subtitles in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Enjoy it!


## Analytics Reporting

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_introduction-activity-6760577606216667136-Te0r)

In a Business or Data Analytics project, reporting is often the essential last step. If you are confused by so many reporting tools, I would suggest the R Markdown. It is easy to start, professional, and supports both R and Python! Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/eYt--tT

Young Excellence Award from University of South Carolina, Fulbright scholar at Brown University and SAS certified professional. He has more than 1600 citations on Google Scholar.

## Why R is the right tool

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_6-reasons-to-learn-r-for-business-2021-activity-6753077434914021376-Qem6)

Why R is the right tool to learn for Business Analytics professionals?
- It better supports business-ready analytics and reports.
- It is easy to learn thanks to tidyverse, a set of packages with a consistent programming interface.

Why not Python, then? When I was in the industry, I feel R is more productive in exploring business problems as it handles data manipulation, modeling, and reporting very well in one platform. Python, as a full-stack programming language, is well-suited for data scientists and engineers. I would suggest both, but do not learn them at the same time if you are new to programming.

See more details about why R is good for business here: https://lnkd.in/e_mBdwR

## Essential SQL Concepts

What is the most important programming skill in Business Analytics? Surprisingly, it is SQL instead of Python/R. SQL's syntax is simple, but it can describe "what you want" from data intuitively and conveniently. Here is a great quick summary of SQL from the perspective of analytics and data science: https://lnkd.in/eEV2kfx

## AWS Big Data Event

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_aws-reinvent-activity-6739676099229364224-XDAN)

Big data is critical in Business Analytics. Amazon AWS is probably the most popular big data platform nowadays. This year, AWS reinvent event is free https://lnkd.in/eqv4Qcp (thanks to my colleague Bilge Karabacak for letting me know). Some topics would be very interesting:
- Jupyter notebooks in Amazon SageMaker (Amazon's online Jupyter notebook)
- How Zynga modernized mobile analytics with Amazon Redshift RA3 (Amazon's data warehouse)
- How to choose the right instance type for ML inference (cloud computing for machine learning)

## Confidence Interval

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_calculating-confidence-interval-with-bootstrapping-activity-6737369570543325184-TJaq)

When I discussed with our graduate assistant about a research project yesterday, I suggested adding the confidence interval (CI) to the descriptive analytics. The understanding of uncertainty is important in business analytics. Here are how to get the empirical CI practically:
1. Bootstrap the data n times (n is data-size dependent, usually 200 to 300).
2. Calculate the metrics for each data set.
3. Identify the 90% CI of metrics by their 5% and 95% percentiles.
Reference the following post for a Python implementation: https://lnkd.in/g_hQRqZ

## Suggestion to students: get hands dirty

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6735202069420003329-7Btr)

Besides the two suggestions I gave students, "continue being curious" and "be a problem solver", the last one is to "get hands dirty".
Business Analytics is to get insights from the historical data and further drive business decisions. Thus, the understanding of data is critical. There is no way to get data ready without getting hands dirty. To this end, I would suggest having a broad exposure to data wrangling tools, including SQL, R, and Python, if possible. If I only pick one, it will be the SQL.
Many new analytics professionals surprisingly found SQL is far more important than what they thought. I used SQL very often when I was a data scientist in the industry. Matt Bonakdarpour, the data science VP of Root Inc., often said, "SQL is the cash you pay to get what you want quickly." When I discussed the M.S in Business Analytics program with our advisory board member, Kimberly Klenk, she also emphasized that SQL is an essential skill. If you are not confident about SQL, here is a good tutorial: https://lnkd.in/ex8r9XN. The cool thing is you can practice SQL in business analytics and see the results just using a web browser.

## Data Cleaning

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6735025440374751233)

There's the joke that 80 percent of data science is cleaning the data and 20 percent is complaining about cleaning the data ðŸ˜ƒ... Here the big takeaway is, the data preparation is really very critical in the industry. The following framework is a great guideline.

## Suggestion to students: be a problem solver

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6734883890625867776-zWJO)

Besides the "continue being curious," my second suggestion to my students is "be a problem solver."
Instead of just monitoring and reporting data, business analytics professionals have more exposure to problem-solving. Thanks to the fast-growing analytics tools, business analytics professionals may not need to know many mathematical details like scientists and to write very complicated code like engineers. However, in my opinion, they do need to clearly understand the principle of data science to support analytical thinking. I highly recommend this book, Data Science for Business (https://lnkd.in/eGHeVkC), as it is easy to read, practical, and very friendly for the working adult learners.


## Suggestion to students: continue being curious

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiang-li-analytics_personalgrowth-professionaldevelopment-education-activity-6734482946864025600-KP-3)

After finish teaching the course on big data analytics last week, what impressed me most is that the students in the Master of Science in Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Health Informatics programs showed a strong motivation and curiosity to learn. At Franklin University, most students are working adults. Learning is challenging because they have to balance work, life, and study. However, they know what they want and are eager to pick up new knowledge, which is fantastic! In the industry, good analysts professionals often ask questions and enjoy learning something new. Thus, my first post-class suggestion to my students is "to continue being curious," which will benefit the career development for sure, from an educator and former data scientist's perspective.
