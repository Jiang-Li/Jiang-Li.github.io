## About Me {.hero-about-title}

I serve as **Program Chair for the M.S. in Business Analytics and B.S. in Analytics**, and **Lead Faculty for the M.S. in Data Analytics** at Franklin University. My unique background combines **industry experience as a Data Scientist** in the insurance sector with **academic research** that includes a publication in **Nature** journal from my physics research at Ohio State University.

Currently, my research focuses on **[Learning Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics)**, exploring how data can transform educational outcomes. I bring this dual perspective of industry practice and academic rigor to analytics education, helping students become effective problem-solvers in real-world contexts.

## Teaching Philosophy

Rather than focusing on specific tools, I emphasize the **ability to learn and adapt** to new technologies. Analytics tools evolve rapidly, but fundamental methodologies remain stable. My students learn to be **problem-solvers first**, then apply appropriate tools to solve those problems.

This approach prepares students for the reality that whatever software is popular today may be different in five years, but strong analytical thinking and adaptability will always be valuable.
